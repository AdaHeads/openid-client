Before trying to compile the OpenID-Client demo, be sure to read the README
and make sure that all the dependencies are met.

Building the OpenID-Client demo is as simple as:

    $ make

If you have a multicore system you can prepend make with PROCESSORS=n to speed
things up.

And that's all. You now have a fully functioning OpenID-Client demo in the exe/
directory. 

You can build a debug version of the demo with:

    $ make debug

If you have valgrind available on your system, you can try running this version
with:

    $ valgrind -v --leak-check=full \
                  --show-possibly-lost=no \
                  --track-origins=yes openid_demo
