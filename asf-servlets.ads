   --
   --  Overriding this method to support a GET request also automatically supports

   --  in the response, only the request header fields.
   --
   --  When overriding this method, read the request data, write the response headers,
   --  get the response's writer or output stream object, and finally, write the
   --  response data. It's best to include content type and encoding.
   --  When using a PrintWriter object to return the response, set the content type
   --  before accessing the PrintWriter object.
   --
   --  The servlet container must write the headers before committing the response,

   --
   --  The GET method should be safe, that is, without any side effects for which
   --  users are held responsible. For example, most form queries have no side effects.
   --  If a client request is intended to change stored data, the request should use
   --  some other HTTP method.
   --
   --  The GET method should also be idempotent, meaning that it can be safely repeated.
   --  Sometimes making a method safe also makes it idempotent. For example, repeating
   --  queries is both safe and idempotent, but buying a product online or modifying
   --  data is neither safe nor idempotent.

   --  accurately.
   --
   --  If you override this method, you can avoid computing the response body and just
   --  set the response headers directly to improve performance. Make sure that the
   --  Do_Head method you write is both safe and idempotent (that is, protects itself
