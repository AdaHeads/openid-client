--  The security context provides contextual information for a security controller to
--  verify that a permission is granted.
--  This security context is used as follows:
--  <ul>
--    <li>An instance of the security context is declared within a function/procedure as
--        a local variable
--    <li>This instance will be associated with the current thread through a task attribute
--    <li>The security context is populated with information to identify the current user,
--        his roles, permissions and other information that could be used by security controllers
--    <li>To verify a permission, the current security context is retrieved and the
--        <b>Has_Permission</b> operation is called,
--    <li>The <b>Has_Permission<b> will first look in a small cache stored in the security context.
--    <li>When not present in the cache, it will use the security manager to find the
--        security controller associated with the permission to verify
--    <li>The security controller will be called with the security context to check the permission.
--        The whole job of checking the permission is done by the security controller.
--        The security controller retrieves information from the security context to decide
--        whether the permission is granted or not.
--    <li>The result produced by the security controller is then saved in the local cache.
--  </ul>
