Before trying to compile OpenID-Client, be sure to read the README and make sure that
all the dependencies are met.

Building and installing OpenID-Client is as simple as:

    Edit makefile.setup to suit your needs
    $ make
    $ make install

If you have a multicore system you can prepend make with PROCESSORS=n to speed
things up.

You can remove OpenID-Client from your system by doing:

    $ make distclean
