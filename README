OpenID authentication for the Ada Web Server library (AWS).

Note that this library in large parts are based on code by Stephane Carrez from
his Ada Server Faces projec[1]. Copyright and license notices are kept in situ
for these files. Everything not specifically marked as originating from the
Ada Server Faces[1] project is GPLv3 and copyright AdaHeads K/S.

It is our (AdaHeads K/S) intention to advocate for an inclusion of this library
in the Ada Web Server[2] project, as the naming of the source files might
indicate.

This library depends on AWS[2], preferably being compiled with SSL support.

See the INSTALL file for instructions on how to build and install the library.
